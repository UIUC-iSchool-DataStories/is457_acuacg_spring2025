# Have you ever seen a confusing or misleading data visualization on social media?

notes:
**ask for a raise of hands**

now is your chance to complain (but in a structured way, and with slides :D)

Bad arguments are not difficult to find in social media. <font color="#FFFFFF"> After reading <a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/"><font color="#FFFFFF">An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments by Almossawi</font></a> and reviewing the <a href="https://datahazards.com/labels.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">Data Hazards website</font></a>, students will identify a "bad argument" in social media (tweet, post, etc.) that uses data or data visualization. This will be an oral presentation with slides. Specifically, you will make a 5-7 minute presentation with 3–5 slides (presentation dates will be assigned) to answer the question: What makes this argument bad and what are the data hazards?</font>

notes:
So, let's go through the description of the assignment in some detail.

As we just discussed, we know that bad arguments are not hard to come by on social media.  In groups, you're going to investigate this in a structured way.

**be aware** while this is called a "Tweet Critique" this is mostly because its a fun sounding name -- you can use posts from Twitter (or X or whatever), Mastadon, Reddit, etc

## The Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments

<img src="https://bookofbadarguments.com/images/1.jpg">

notes:
the first tool we'll be using is the online illustrated book of bad arguments which has a set of examples of common *logical fallacies* which are illustrated with (in my opinion) wonderfully creepy animal pictures

notes:
... the logical fallacies you'll want to draw from to see which apply to your particular "tweet".  These are basically an error in reasoning which leads to a faulty argument (see their formal definition of an argument)...

## The Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments

<img src="images/bookOfBadArg/definition_p52_3.png" alt="book of bad arguments definitions page, page 52, different highlights" width=70%>

notes:
... there are many reasons that one can make an error in reasoning including **read the list** and this book gives a quick overview of several common errors.

## Data Hazard Labels

notes:
In addition to logical fallacies, you'll be pulling from the Data Hazards Labels, which have direct implications for using data in various ways, including in visualizations aimed at the public on social media. 

Here are just two examples **read** but there are several others which might apply to the data shown in your chosen social media post.

notes:
... after reading the Book of Bad Arguments and the Data Hazards Labels, you'll have a better idea of what you are looking for for your particular "bad argument" social media post.   

You just need to find one post using data or a data visualization -- but be sure to check the rubric for the assignment as this will likely be easier to do with a post that has some data visualization in the tweet

## Tweet Critiques: Things we’re looking for

1. Clarity: Is the bad argument clearly explained?
2. Data visualization: is the problematic visualization included and explained?
3. Analysis: Is the bad argument analyzed, in relation to the categories of bad arguments from Almossawi, Data Hazards, and anything else that makes this bad?
4. Audience engagement: Is there a clear strategy for engaging the audience in the presentation?
