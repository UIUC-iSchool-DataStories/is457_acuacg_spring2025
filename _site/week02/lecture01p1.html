## Participation Guidelines - Presentations

<div>All presentations will be <b>in person</b> - no hybrid/online options available.</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<br />

<div>This includes presentations that will take place in the last two weeks of class.</div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Grading - Categories

 * 10% -- Participation/Attendance
 * 10% -- Reading Quizzes (\~weekly, more heavily toward the start of class)
 * 10% -- Graded in class activities (\~weekly or every other week, individual and group)
 * 25% -- Minor Projects (MiP, individual & groups)
 * 45% -- Major Projects (MP, groups)

notes:
with this idea of the course, let's look at the overall way grading is going to work in this course

you will dive into the details more for the syllabus quiz, which is an assignment due next week designed to get you familiar with these details :D

some of the assignments are still being developed (you'll see notes in the assignments where this is the case) so expect a few things to be "flushed out" over the next few weeks

There *IS* a reading list however that you can access to "look ahead" at all of the reading for the course.

also about reading quizzes: as these are new, there might be some errors in them!  if you think we got something wrong, let us know so we can fix it and update your grade accordingly!

 * 25% -- Minor Projects (MiP, individual & groups)
 * 45% -- Major Projects (MP, groups)

notes:

**be aware** the in class activities are really "in class" activities in that some times there will be more than one assigned during class, in which case, any beyond the "main" one will be due several days after the course

more details on the graded in class activities next week when we start using them! as folks are still shifting around classes, we won't be grading any in class stuff this week
