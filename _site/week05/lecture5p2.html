# Intro to PowerBI

## What is PowerBI?


<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/media/power-bi-overview/power-bi-overview-blocks.png">


notes:
first let's ask, what exactly is PowerBI? 

and then we can ask, how are we going to be using it in this class?

## What is PowerBI?

From the ["PowerBI Overview"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview):

> Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:
> 
> * A Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.
> * An online software as a service (SaaS) service called the Power BI service.
> * Power BI Mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

notes:
here is a direct quote from one of the introductory overviews of powerbi

notes:
Since not everybody has a windows machine, myself included, we'll be focused on the online-only version of PowerBI

you are welcome to use the desktop app if you want, just be aware instructions may be slightly different, and I won't be able to help you debug your visualizations as easily

The online link is [https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=power-bi).

notes:
The link is available on the top of our Canvas Modules page, and linked here as well.

notes:
for ease of access, you probably want to "pin" this to your side bar

## How to get setup on PowerBI

<img src="images/powerbi/powerbi_first_view.png" width="90%" style='border:1px solid #000000'>

notes:
when it opens up, you should see an interface that looks something like the following

Unless you have worked here before, you probably won't have anything listed like my very informationally-named "MessingAround1" report shown at the bottom of this screen

## How to get setup on PowerBI

It is *strongly* suggested you use the Chrome Browser for this!

notes:
other browsers *may* work, but Firefox was a bit buggy for me

# Intro to Excel

notes:
raising of hands, how many folks have messed around in Excel at all?

---

## What is Excel?

Excel is an online/downloadable spreadsheet software for tabular data analysis.

notes:
for the purposes of this class, we'll just use Excel as a way to read in and modify tables...

We will be using the downloadable version in order to make use of [Power Query](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query) to do some data transformations.

notes:
... in order to do some data transformations with Power Query.

Power query is something we won't be using today, but we will starting next week, so it will be good to have Excel already downloaded on your computer and ready to go for next week.

notes:
This will be something we'll use with our third walkthrough, starting in the next week or so, and we'll have time to work on making sure this downloads OK on your computer at the end of class, but to install...

### Again, we will have time at the end of class to set up Excel -- focus on logging into PowerBI first!

notes:
again, focus on getting powerbi set up right now, Excel just needs to be installed on your laptop that you bring to class for what we will be doing in the coming weeks!
