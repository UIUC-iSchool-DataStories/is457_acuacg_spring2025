Bad arguments are not difficult to find in social media. <font color="#FFFFFF"> After reading <a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/"><font color="#FFFFFF">An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments by Almossawi</font></a> and reviewing the <a href="https://datahazards.com/labels.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">Data Hazards website</font></a>, students will identify a "bad argument" in social media (tweet, post, etc.) that uses data or data visualization. This will be an oral presentation with slides. Specifically, you will make a 5-7 minute presentation with 3–5 slides (presentation dates will be assigned) to answer the question: What makes this argument bad and what are the data hazards?</font>
