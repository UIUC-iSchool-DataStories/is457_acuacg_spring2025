# Have you ever seen a confusing or misleading data visualization on social media?

notes:
**ask for a raise of hands**

now is your chance to complain (but in a structured way, and with slides :D)

notes:
So, let's go through the description of the assignment in some detail.

As we just discussed, we know that bad arguments are not hard to come by on social media.  In groups, you're going to investigate this in a structured way.

**be aware** while this is called a "Tweet Critique" this is mostly because its a fun sounding name -- you can use posts from Twitter (or X or whatever), Mastadon, Reddit, etc

## The Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments

<img src="https://bookofbadarguments.com/images/1.jpg">

notes:
the first tool we'll be using is the online illustrated book of bad arguments which has a set of examples of common *logical fallacies* which are illustrated with (in my opinion) wonderfully creepy animal pictures

notes:
... the logical fallacies you'll want to draw from to see which apply to your particular "tweet".  These are basically an error in reasoning which leads to a faulty argument (see their formal definition of an argument)...

notes:
... there are many reasons that one can make an error in reasoning including **read the list** and this book gives a quick overview of several common errors.

## Data Hazard Labels

notes:
In addition to logical fallacies, you'll be pulling from the Data Hazards Labels, which have direct implications for using data in various ways, including in visualizations aimed at the public on social media. 

Here are just two examples **read** but there are several others which might apply to the data shown in your chosen social media post.

notes:
... after reading the Book of Bad Arguments and the Data Hazards Labels, you'll have a better idea of what you are looking for for your particular "bad argument" social media post.   

You just need to find one post using data or a data visualization -- but be sure to check the rubric for the assignment as this will likely be easier to do with a post that has some data visualization in the tweet

## Tweet Critiques: Things we’re looking for

notes:
if you check out the rubric for this assignment (it is linked on Canvas), you'll see there are a few things we are looking for

---

## Tweet Critiques: Things we’re looking for

1. Clarity: Is the bad argument clearly explained? 

notes:
First, you want to fully be able to explain the argument that is being made in the social media post you are showing.

How will you make sure your audience is following this?

---

## Tweet Critiques: Things we’re looking for

1. Clarity: Is the bad argument clearly explained? 
1. Data visualization: is the problematic visualization included and explained? 

notes:
You will also want to make sure your audience (us) can fully follow *why* the visualization is problematic.

This can be tricky with confusing visualizations, so you will have to spend some some time carefully considering how you'll make the issues with the confusing visualization clear to your audience. 

---

## Tweet Critiques: Things we’re looking for

1. Clarity: Is the bad argument clearly explained? 
1. Data visualization: is the problematic visualization included and explained? 
1. Analysis: Is the bad argument analyzed, in relation to the categories of bad arguments from Almossawi and anything else that makes this bad? 

notes:
You'll want to clearly explain which of the logical fallacies apply to your chosen social media post.

1. Analysis: Is the bad argument analyzed, in relation to the categories of bad arguments from Almossawi and anything else that makes this bad? 
1. Analysis: Is the appropriate Data Hazard Label discussed in relation to the data used in the visualization presented? 

notes:
You'll also want to pick out which of the data hazard labels apply to your post as well.

1. Audience engagement: Is there a clear strategy for engaging the audience in the presentation? 

notes:
Finally, we want you to think a bit about how to keep your audience engaged in your presentation.

We'll talk about specific strategies as we go along in the class, but we want you to start thinking about this now.
