# Tips to Declutter Slides

notes:
so, during your MP1's and in your feedback you'll notice that we definitely emphasized that slides/viz needs to be clear to your audience.

some folks have already started using arrows/boxes to display these things, but we wanted to give some more examples of these from some "real life" talks

---

## Break down cluttered slides

* Avoid big text blocks
* Break text across multiple slides
* If you need to duplicate a graph/chart, consider annotating the second appearance to direct the audience's attention
